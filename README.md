# Tic Tac Toe App ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe App for Android! This app was developed by me, Ashish Prasad, as my first Android project. It was created with the intention of learning fundamental concepts of Android app development using Java programming language.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the players take turns to place their marks, either 'X' or 'O', on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. The app provides an intuitive interface for an engaging gaming experience and includes a convenient reset button to start a new game.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Play against a friend and take turns to compete in the timeless game of Tic Tac Toe.

- **Interactive 3x3 Grid**: The app features a visually appealing 3x3 grid of interactive buttons that represent the game board.

- **X and O Marks**: Each player can place their chosen mark ('X' or 'O') on the grid during their turn.

- **Reset Button**: A reset button is provided to swiftly clear the grid and begin a new game whenever desired.

## Technologies Utilized

The development of this app involved the use of several key technologies:

- **Android Studio**: The primary integrated development environment (IDE) used for creating, testing, and deploying the Android app.

- **Java**: The programming language used for coding the functional logic and mechanics of the app.

- **XML**: Utilized for designing the user interface, including the layout and appearance of buttons and other elements.

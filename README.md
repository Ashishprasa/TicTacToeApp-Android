Tic Tac Toe

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe app for Android. It was my first app, and I created it to learn some concepts of Android development in Java.
The app uses a 3x3 grid of buttons. Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their marks (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.
The app also includes a reset button that allows players to start a new game.
This app is a simple project, but it helped me to learn the basics of Android development. I hope that other beginners will find it helpful as well.
